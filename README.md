## ‚úèÔ∏è About

This is the backend for the final project of the Explorer course at [Rocketseat School](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/). To access the entire course assignments click [this link](https://github.com/jeadamek/explorer-rocketseat). 


In this project, the challenge was to build an API using Node.js, the frontend was developed using Reactjs, to access click on [this link](https://github.com/jeadamek/food-explorer-frontend).

This is an API application for a fictional restaurant that allows administrators to manage dishes and orders, and clients to create accounts, place orders, and manage their profiles.

The database diagram can be seen in the image below:<br/>
